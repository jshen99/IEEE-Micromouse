# IEEE-Micromouse Spring 2018

**Day 0: Parts needed:**

- Microcontroller (Arduino Nano)
- Breadboard
- Motors (2 or 4) : Pololu #3049 Micro metal Gearmotor HPCB 12V with Extended Motor Shaft
- Distance sensors
- Encoders
- Battery
- Step up regulator
- Chasiss
- wheels
- Motor Controller
- Castor wheels (dependent on number of wheels)

 **Agenda**

1. soldering motor motor controller encoders and distance sensors and Downloading in the drivers onto the teensyduino
2. Write up software to process distance sensor and encoder data sent up to the arduino
3. Start testing if the wheels move based on different distance on the distance sensors
